# Canvas Notes Video Downloader 

Automates the process of opening a page of notes from [my university's canvas site](webcourses.ucf.edu), finding embedded videos, changing the resolution, and downloading them with a descriptive filename

## Motivations

I wrote this tool to save myself time by automating a repetitive task I had to do over and over. At the time of writing, I am graduating college and have been archiving course content for my own use after graduation. However, I probably spent more time making this than I will save... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
